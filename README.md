# The-Echo-Sentinel

Echo Sentinel focused on automating laptop tasks using speech recognition technology. By integrating tools like pyautogui, speech-to-text (STT), text-to-speech (TTS), and natural language processing (NLP), we created a system capable of executing commands through voice commands. This project aims to enhance user accessibility and productivity through innovative automation techniques.
Output: Utilizing speech recognition, automate tasks on laptop effortlessly, including powering off, fetching information from ChatGpt and playing videos and music, all through voice commands.
Topics Covered: done using pyautogui, STT, TTS, NLP
